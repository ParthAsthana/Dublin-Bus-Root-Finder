# Dublin-Bus-Root-Finder
  - Dublin Bus Route Finder. The software was designed by viewing Dublin as being comprised of a number of nodes in a graph (locations) and edges between those nodes (roads/bus routes/train tracks). Each edge has a weight which depends on how long it will take you to travel towards your intended destination via that route. Given nodes, edges and weights, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm was used to determine the optimal route to get you from where you are to where you want to be.
