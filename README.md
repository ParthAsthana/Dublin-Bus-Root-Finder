- Dublin Bus Route Finder. The software was designed by viewing Dublin as being comprised of a number of nodes in a graph (locations) and edges between those nodes (roads/bus routes/train tracks). Each edge has a weight which depends on how long it will take you to travel towards your intended destination via that route. Given nodes, edges and weights, Dijkstra’s algorithm was used to determine the optimal route to get you from where you are to where you want to be.
